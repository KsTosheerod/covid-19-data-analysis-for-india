Project name
Covid19 data analysis for India.

Project objective:
COVID-19 is an infectious disease which is spreading very fast globally, leaving millions of lives at stake. Currently, transparency is maintained regarding the information of infected cases, recovered cases, deaths and projections but there are no detailed records to it.
The aim of this project is to analyze the data of a particular country, taking each and every state and district into consideration so that maximum and minimum effected places can be figured out easily. And there will be graphical presentation of the records which would help people in better understanding the situation of their country, state and district and would help them in knowing how important it is to take precautions and be safe and save otherâ€™s lives too.
What is the current COVID-19 situation in a particular country, states and districts?
How important it is to understand the situation and take precautions?




Motivation

What is COVID-19?
Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.
In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19. It is a contagious and air borne disease. This new virus was unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.It is now a pandemic effecting globally.
As it is effecting entire world it caught my interest to contribute in this regard. So I am choosing a particular country India and analysing the data to show some detailed and accurate information of coronavirus cases, because India has a largest population around the world. In addition, project includes graphical presentations as well.
